# UPENN_DSBC_PythonAPI_Challenge

## During this API Challenge, I had an issue with the import api_keys for the Vacation.py file. It just would not work for me and so I created a variable in the file with my API key for geoapify. That worked fine. I did not have any issues with the Weather.py file importing my weather api key.

## To complete this challenge, I used examples from the classwork, worked with fellow classmates, watched YouTube tutorials, and visited websites such as Stack Overflow and GeeksforGeeks. All were very helpful.
